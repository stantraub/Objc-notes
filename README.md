nil values
-can invoke a method on a nil pointer with not issues unlike swift
-if a method invoked returns a number or a pointer, the value returned will be 0

Mutability
-by default all objects are mutable

NSArray vs NSMutableArray
-can append to mutable array

Swift- statically typed

Objective C - static and dynamic type combination

Inheritance
-ObjC has single inheritance (classes can only inherit from one other class)
-Both Swift and ObjC achieve something akin to multiple inheritance through the widespread use of protocols
